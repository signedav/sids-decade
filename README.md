![sidhochwind](assets/sidhochwind-title.png)

## What?

This is Sid's decade between his 30th and 40th birthday. 

## Why?

When his brother left a few days after Sid's 30th birthday to do his PhD at Cambridge, he told him that he would post a photo on Instagram from time to time, so Sid decided to do the same. One photo a day... Anyway after a while, his brother stopped making photos. But Sid just kept going. As well a little bit as replacement of his [lomography](assets/rio-lomos.jpg) passion, that became a expensive. Every day (more or less, but at least on average) he took a photo of something he happened to see. On his 40th birthday, he had enough and stopped.

## Where?

Well [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/sidhochwind/). But since Sid is getting too old to support dazzling companies, he may suddenly delete the account on a whim. It will still be here https://signedav.github.io/sids-decade/ I know this is Microsoft but yes... I don't know...

## Who the ... is Sid?

Sid Hochwind. Pseudonym. Sid is the short form of Signer Dave and Hochwind because of [Highwind](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Cid_Highwind).
