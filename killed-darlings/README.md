## Killed Darlings

I took 365 photos per year. However, sometimes I also made videos. These are not usable for the walls. And I forgot the leap years. Therefore it is not correct anyway. So I do a fix 360 and deleted some on Insta. These pictures here I deleted on Insta. So here is the "graveyard". But some of them were copied back. Because I sometimes deleted too much. It's a mess. I'm a bit stupid and very, very tired.
